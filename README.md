# 🧠 Machine Learning Regression Model Comparison

This project presents a comprehensive comparison of multiple regression models—**Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**—to predict a continuous target variable from structured data. The objective is to evaluate and visualize each model’s performance using industry-standard metrics and help identify the most suitable model.

## 📈 Problem Statement

The task is to build and compare machine learning models that predict a continuous numerical outcome (e.g., price, demand, sales) using structured data. The evaluation is based on the following performance metrics:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

📊 Model Evaluation Results
Model	MAE	MSE	RMSE	R² Score
Decision Tree	44,279	3.54e+09	59,512	0.935
Random Forest	22,773	8.98e+08	29,964	0.984
XGBoost	18,426	5.43e+08	23,310	0.990
Linear Regression	113,303	2.32e+10	152,358	0.574

📉 Visual Comparisons
📍 Radar Chart
Normalized comparison across all four metrics for each model.


📍 Bar Charts
Separate bar plots comparing MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².


✅ Key Takeaways
✅ XGBoost outperformed all other models across every metric.

✅ Random Forest also delivered strong performance, especially on error reduction.

⚠️ Linear Regression significantly underperformed, suggesting that the data is non-linear in nature.

📊 Visual tools helped interpret model effectiveness clearly and intuitively.

📌 data_science_101.png: Four bar charts displaying MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²

🔮 Future Enhancements
🔍 Add feature importance visualizations using SHAP or permutation importance.

🧪 Use Optuna or Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

🚀 Deploy the best-performing model with Flask or FastAPI as a REST API.

🛠 Implement an ML pipeline using MLflow or DVC for version control and reproducibility.
