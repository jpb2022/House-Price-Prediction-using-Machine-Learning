# 🧠 Machine Learning Model Comparison for Regression

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of training, evaluating, and comparing different regression models to predict a continuous target variable using **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Linear Regression**. The models are assessed based on key performance metrics, and visual comparisons are provided to identify the best model.

## 📊 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to train regression models that can accurately predict a target variable (e.g., price or sales) from structured data. We compare model performance using the following metrics:

- **MAE** - Mean Absolute Error
- **MSE** - Mean Squared Error
- **RMSE** - Root Mean Squared Error
- **R² Score** - Coefficient of Determination

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* **XGBoost** performed the best across all evaluation metrics.
* **Random Forest** also performed well but was slightly behind XGBoost.
* **Linear Regression** underperformed, indicating non-linear patterns in data.
* Visualization helped in interpreting model performance clearly.
