# 🧠 Regression Model Comparison for Predictive Analytics

This project focuses on comparing multiple regression models—**Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Linear Regression**—to identify the most effective model for predicting a target variable. The evaluation is based on multiple performance metrics and includes both **quantitative analysis** and **visualization**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To evaluate and compare the performance of different regression algorithms on a given dataset using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R². The ultimate goal is to select the best-performing model for predicting continuous values.

---

## 📊 Models Used

1. **Linear Regression** – Baseline model to understand linear relationships.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor** – A simple, interpretable model.
3. **Random Forest Regressor** – Ensemble of decision trees for higher accuracy.
4. **XGBoost Regressor** – Gradient boosting algorithm with powerful performance.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average absolute errors.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Square root of MSE for interpretability.
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**: Measures goodness of fit.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- 📊 **Bar Charts** comparing model metrics.
- 🕸️ **Radar Chart** for normalized metric comparison.
- 🖼️ Visual outputs saved as high-resolution PNGs for presentation use.

## 📦 Installation & Requirements

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

### 🔧 Required Libraries

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**`requirements.txt`** includes:

```text
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
seaborn
```

> ⚠️ For GPU acceleration with XGBoost, ensure CUDA is set up and install GPU-compatible XGBoost via conda:
>
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
> ```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regression-model-comparison.git
   cd regression-model-comparison
   ```

2. Place your cleaned dataset in the working directory.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script file:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook model_comparison.ipynb
   ```

4. Output visualizations and model results will be saved locally.

## 📸 Sample Results

### ✅ Best Model: **XGBoost**

| Metric | Value  |
| ------ | ------ |
| MAE    | 18,425 |
| MSE    | 543M   |
| RMSE   | 23,310 |
| R²     | 0.990  |

📉 Radar and bar charts highlight the superior performance of XGBoost over other models.
