# 🧠 Regression Model Comparison for Predictive Analytics

This project presents a comparative analysis of various regression algorithms—**Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**—to determine the most effective model for predicting continuous target values. We evaluate models using key performance metrics and provide rich visualizations for insights.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To evaluate and compare the performance of multiple regression algorithms using a structured dataset. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for predicting continuous numeric outputs based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.

---

## 📊 Models Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**
   Simple baseline model for linear relationships.

2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   Non-linear and interpretable tree-based model.

3. **Random Forest Regressor**
   Ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction robustness.

4. **XGBoost Regressor**
   Gradient boosting framework optimized for performance and speed.

---

## 📐 Evaluation Metrics

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Measures average absolute errors between predicted and actual values.
* **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – Square root of MSE for more interpretable error magnitude.
* **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)** – Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The following visualizations are included to aid comparison:

* 📊 **Bar Charts** showing metric values across models.
* 🕸️ **Radar Charts** for normalized performance comparison.
* 📁 Saved as high-resolution `.png` files for reports or presentations.

## 📸 Sample Results

📌 **Best Performing Model**: `XGBoost Regressor`

| Metric | Value       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| MAE    | 18,425      |
| MSE    | 543,000,000 |
| RMSE   | 23,310      |
| R²     | 0.990       |

📊 Visualizations clearly indicate that XGBoost significantly outperforms the other models across all evaluation metrics.
